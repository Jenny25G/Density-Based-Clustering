# Density-Based-Clustering
DBSCAN stands for Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise. This technique is one of the most common clustering algorithms which works based on density of object. The whole idea is that if a particular point belongs to a cluster, it should be near to lots of other points in that cluster.
